# JavaMinesweeperClone
Work in progress. 
### What I still need to add:
* right click to mark bomb (add a little flag icon. if right clicked again it will revert to the blank button)
* counters for: time, remaining bombs
* left clicking a bomb ends the game
* aethetic
* fix up the fxn that opens up large empty spaces (only open empty tiles directly beside, above, or below. not diagonal)
* make a start screen where you can see previous times, choose # of bombs and grid size.
		  (with edge cases for impossible grid size & bomb combinations)
### What I have:
* most of the important functions like creating a grid with random bombs and the correct numbers. 
		  (with any # of bombs and any size for the grid. They're specified in Run.java) 
* opening up empty spaces nearby if an empty tile is clicked.
* clicking on a tile with display the value of it
